As a result of the Consolidation, it is expected that the 88,745,454 Shares which are currently issued and outstanding will be reduced to approximately 8,874,545 Shares, subject to rounding. No fractional Shares will be issued as a result of the Consolidation. Any fractional share interest of 0.5 or higher arising from the Consolidation will be rounded up to one whole Share, and any fractional share interest of less than 0.5 will be cancelled. The Company's name and stock symbols will remain unchanged following the Consolidation.</p><p>In accordance with the Articles of the Company, the Consolidation may be approved by the board of directors of the Company and shareholder approval is not required.</p><p>Shareholders who hold their Shares through a securities broker or other intermediary and do not have Shares registered in their name will not be required to take any measures with respect to the Consolidation. Letters of transmittal with respect to the Consolidation will be mailed to all registered shareholders of the Company. All registered shareholders who submit a duly completed letter of transmittal along with their respective share certificate(s) representing the pre-consolidated Shares to the Company's transfer agent, Odyssey Trust Company, will receive a certificate representing the post-consolidated Shares.</p><p>The Company believes that the Consolidation may have the effect of, among other things: increasing the interest of the financial community in the Company and potentially broadening its pool of investors; improving trading liquidity; and improving the Company's position to obtain financing and pursue new opportunities.</p><p><strong>About NV Gold Corporation</strong></p><p>NV Gold Corporation is a well-organized exploration company with ~89 million shares issued and no debt.

Copper Alloys division sales of $7 million were higher by 24.1% quarter-over-quarter (&quot;Q/Q&quot;) and Engineered Materials division sales of $3 million increased by 66% Q/Q.</li><li>On a consolidated basis, IBC booked net income of $712,000 or $0.01 per share, as compared to a loss of $394,000 or ($0.02) per share in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (&quot;Adjusted EBITDA&quot;)<sup> [1] </sup>rose to $1.9 million in the quarter, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA in the comparable prior-year period of $673,000 and swung to positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million in the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($269,000) in the comparable prior-year period.</li><li>Operating income in the quarter of $1.5 million, and $1.14 million in the year to date, compared to $203,000 and ($1.2 million), respectively, in the comparable prior-year periods.</li><li>Gross profit and gross margins in the quarter improved in both divisions, largely due to higher sales revenue as compared to the prior-year periods resulting in fixed costs forming a lower proportion of sales.</li></ul><p><strong>FRANKLIN, IN / ACCESSWIRE / February 13, 2024 /</strong> IBC Advanced Alloys Corp. (&quot;<strong> IBC</strong> &quot; or the &quot;<strong> Company</strong> &quot;) (<strong>TSXV:IB)(OTCQB:IAALF</strong>) announces its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.</p><p>IBC swing to profitability in the quarter, for the first time in seven quarters, recording net income of $712,000, or $0.01 per share, as compared to a loss of $394,000, or ($0.00) per share, in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. In the six-month period ended December 31, 2023, IBC booked a loss of $222,000 or ($0.00) per share, as compared to a loss of $2.4 million or ($0.03) in the comparable prior-year period. This performance was driven largely by increased sales and stronger gross margin performance in the Copper Alloys division, coupled with higher sales revenue from the Engineered Materials division of beryllium-aluminum products used in defense markets.</p><p>Consolidated sales rose to $10 million in the quarter, a 34.1% increase over the prior-year period, with both operating divisions booking significantly higher revenue driven by higher sales volumes and improved pricing. Gross profit and gross margins also improved across both divisions, as did operating income and Adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>&quot;IBC's teams in both operating divisions did a fantastic job to close out calendar 2023 on a high note, and this has provided us with good additional momentum in 2024,&quot; said Mark A. Smith, Chairman and CEO of IBC. &quot;Increased sales and stronger gross margin performance in the Copper Alloys division helped to lead the way in the quarter, and higher sales revenue from our Engineered Materials division of beryllium-aluminum alloy products for defense markets contributed significantly.&quot;</p><p>IBC is continuing to explore strategic options with potential partners, investors, and others regarding the Engineered Materials division and its Wilmington, Mass facility. These options include, but are not limited to, pursuit of additional contracts, joint ventures, restructuring, sale of assets, sale of the division, or closure of the division, and other possibilities. IBC will update the market as this effort progresses.</p><p><strong>CONSOLIDATED RESULTS</strong></p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:100%\" width=\"100%\"><table style=\"background-color:hsl(0,

IBC believes that operating income (loss) helps identify underlying trends in the business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that the Company includes in loss for the period, and provides useful information about core operating results, enhances the overall understanding of past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by management in financial and operational decision-making. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful indicator for cash flow generated by the business that is independent of IBC's capital structure.</p><p>Operating income (loss)<sup> </sup>and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the period or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. Operating income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA<sup> </sup>presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to IBC's data.</p><p><strong>OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)</strong></p><p>Operating income (loss) represents income or loss for the quarter, and year to date, excluding foreign exchange loss, interest expense, interest income, other income (expense) and income taxes that the Company does not believe are reflective of its core operating performance during the periods presented. A reconciliation of the quarter and year-to-date loss to operating income (loss) follows:</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:100%\" width=\"100%\"><table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td

Proceeds from the Private Placement will be used for accelerating exploration, development, construction activities, as well as corporate G&amp;A and general working capital requirements.</p><p>Tranche 1 of the Private Placement consists of issuing 6,816,323 Shares priced at C$0.72 per Share. The Shares issued pursuant to the Private Placement will be subject to a four-month hold period. Closing of the Private Placement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. In connection with the Private Placement, the Company paid $144,170.86 in cash and issued 125,472 Shares in equity as finder's fees.</p><p>A director and an officer of the Company participated in the Private Placement for an aggregate amount of $57,600. The transaction with the officer constitutes a &quot;related party transaction&quot; as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (&quot;MI 61-101&quot;). The Company is relying on the exemptions under section 5.5(a) and section 5.7(1)(a) from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the Units issued to the related party and the consideration paid by the related party under the Private Placement does not exceed 25% of Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101. The Company did not file a material change report in respect of the related party transaction at least 21 days before the closing of the Private Placement, as the details of the participation by related party of the Company were not settled until shortly prior to closing of the Private Placement.</p><p><strong><u>About South Star Battery Metals Corp</u></strong></p><p>South Star Battery Metals Corp. is a Canadian battery metals project developer focused on the selective acquisition and development of near-term production projects in the Americas. South Star's Santa Cruz Graphite Project, located in Southern Bahia, Brazil is the first of a series of industrial and battery metals projects that will be put into production. Brazil is the second-largest graphite-producing region in the world with more than 80 years of continuous mining. Santa Cruz has at-surface mineralization in friable materials, and successful large-scale pilot-plant testing (&gt; 30t) has been completed. The results of the testing show that approximately 65% of Cg concentrate is +80 mesh with good recoveries and 95%-99% Cg. With excellent infrastructure and logistics, South Star is fully funded for Phase 1, and the construction and commissioning are underway. Santa Cruz will be the first new graphite production in the Americas since 1996 with Phase 1 commercial production projected in Q1 2024. Phase 2 production (25,000 tpa) is partially funded and planned for 2026, while Phase 3 (50,000 tpa) is scheduled for 2028.</p><p>South Star's second project in the development pipeline is strategically located in Alabama in the center of a developing electric vehicle, aerospace, and defense hub in the southeastern United States. The BamaStar Project is a historic mine active during World Wars I &amp; II. A NI43-101 technical report with the maiden resource estimate has been filed on SEDAR. Trenching, phase 1 drilling, sampling, analysis, and preliminary metallurgical testing have been completed. The testing indicates a traditional crush/grind/flotation concentration circuit that achieved grades of approximately 94-97% Cg with approximately 86% recoveries. South Star is executing on its plan to create a multi-asset, diversified battery metals company with near-term operations in strategic jurisdictions. South Star trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol STS, and on the OTCQB under the symbol STSBF.</p><p>South Star is committed to a corporate culture, project execution plan and safe operations that embrace the highest standards of ESG principles based on transparency, stakeholder engagement, ongoing education, and stewardship.

(TSXV:GGL) (&quot;GGL&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) announces a non-brokered private placement offering (the &quot;Offering&quot;) to consist of the sale of up to 6,000,000 common shares at a price of $0.05 per share, to raise gross proceeds of up to $300,000.</p><p>Insiders may participate in the private placement and finders' fees or brokers' commissions may be paid in accordance with TSX Venture Exchange policies.</p><p>All securities issued as part of the Offering will be subject to a hold period in Canada of four months plus one day from closing. The proceeds from the Offering, which is subject to TSX Venture Exchange acceptance, will be used for exploration and development activities at the Company's Gold Point Project in the Walker Lane Trend of western Nevada and for general working capital purposes.</p><p><strong>Exploration update</strong></p><p>GGL is pleased to announce that it has commenced an Induced Polarization (IP) Survey over the Le Champ copper-molybdenum porphyry target at its road-accessible Gold Point Project in the Walker Lane Trend of Western Nevada.</p><p>The IP survey will be centered over abundant stockwork veining and silica alteration identified by recent mapping at Le Champ. This alteration is believed to mark the upper levels of a buried porphyry system. The strongly elevated molybdenum values and more subdued, but still noteworthy, copper results are consistent with a leached system, and suggest that stronger mineralization could be found at depth. It is anticipated that the IP survey could delineate this sulphide mineralization.</p><p>Geological mapping at Le Champ identified six separate intrusive phases within the Sylvania Plutonic Complex hosting extensive stockwork and sheeted vein zones. The strongest molybdenum-in-soil anomalies are associated with the stockwork zones. Copper-in-soil geochemistry is moderately anomalous throughout the target area with the strongest values near shallowly south-dipping fault structures and stockwork zones.</p><p>Large magmatic breccias containing limonite altered cubes and clots, often up to 2 cm across, were identified on the north side of the target area near historical workings containing copper mineralization. A float sample comprising limonite clots collected from the breccia returned 6.29% copper and 203 g/t silver. The exact timing of the brecciation is not yet known, but is thought to be a late event as it includes clasts of mafic dykes which are seen elsewhere on surface cutting the other intrusive phases.</p><p><strong>Surface Sampling</strong></p><p>Field crews will also complete systematic surveying and sampling of veins on newly acquired claims, located about 700 m along strike to the west of the main underground workings on the Orleans Vein (see <a href=\"https://pr.report/esFY4q3D\">news release date January 16, 2024</a>). There are numerous historical surface and underground workings on the new claims. These workings have not yet been mapped or sampled by the Company, but mineralization closely resembles that found in high-grade veins system elsewhere on the Gold Point property.</p><p><strong>Setting of Le Champ</strong></p><p>Le Champ is located about 3.5 km west of the gold-rich veins that have been the focus of historical exploration at Gold Point. The porphyry lies within the Late to Middle-Jurassic Sylvania Granitic Complex, a multi-phase intrusive suite that covers an area greater than 400 km<sup>2</sup> along the Nevada-California border stretching between Fish Lake Valley to the north and Death Valley to the south. It typically ranges in composition from granite to quartz monzonite, but locally contains more mafic phases. This pluton is similar in age to intrusions that host large porphyry systems in the Yerington district of Walker Lane, 249 km to the northwest.</p><p>The Walker Lane hosts four significant known porphyry deposits (Yerington, Ann Mason, Bear, and MacArthur), all of which are located near Yerington.</p><p>The Yerington Mine was operated by the Anaconda Company from 1952 until 1979 and produced approximately 1.744 billion pounds of copper at an average grade 0.54% copper. This deposit, along with the Bear and MacArthur deposit are currently held by Lion Copper and Gold.</p><p>The Ann Mason deposit is owned by Hudbay Minerals Inc. and contains 2.2 billion tonnes of measured and indicated resources grading 0.29% copper and 67 ppm molybdenum.</p><p><strong>About Gold Point</strong></p><p>The Gold Point Project is accessed by Highway 774 and comprises 375 lode claims and 7 patented claims covering a total area of approximately 7,443 acres (30.1 km<sup>2</sup>). It is situated within the Walker Lane, a major mineral belt that has seen significant historical production from gold, silver, and copper mines. Many companies are actively exploring in the belt including several majors.</p><p>The Gold Point Project covers several past-producing underground mines that explored along parts of four prominent vein structures. These main structures are paralleled by several other lightly explored structures. The mines operated intermittently from the 1880s to the early 1960s, producing gold and silver from mesothermal veins. The mineralization is strongly oxidized to the bottom of the workings, which reached a maximum depth of 1,020 ft (311 m) downdip.</p><p><strong>Qualified Person</strong></p><p>Technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Matthew R. Dumala, P.Eng., a geological engineer with Archer, Cathro &amp; Associates (1981) Limited and a qualified person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101.</p><p><strong>About GGL Resources Corp.</strong></p><p>GGL is a seasoned, Canadian-based junior exploration company, focused on the exploration and advancement of under evaluated mineral assets in politically stable, mining friendly jurisdictions. The Company has optioned and wholly owned claims in the Gold Point district of the prolific Walker Lane Trend, Nevada. The Gold Point claims cover several gold-silver veins, four of which host past producing high-grade mines, and an exciting new porphyry discovery. The Company also owns the McConnell Project, which hosts epithermal gold veins and an under explored porphyry copper-gold prospect in the Kemess District of north-central British Colombia. GGL also holds diamond royalties on mineral leases adjacent to the Gahcho Kué diamond mine in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD</p><p><i>&quot;W.

The Property, comprising 5,894 hectares (includes Star Lake, KA, Greenwater Lake &amp; Kekekuab Lake groups), is located 70 km west of the City of Thunder Bay and 5 km southwest of the past-producing Shebandowan Ni-Cu-Co-Cr-PGE mine, operated by Inco Ltd. during the period of 1970 to 1998. <strong>The Shebandowan mine is a world-class example of a primary magmatic nickel sulphide deposit, with produced tonnage &amp; grade of 8.7 MT at 2.0% nickel, 1.0% copper, 3.0 g/t platinum + palladium (cobalt and chrome grades unknown).</strong></p><p>Mackenzie (Mac) Watson, Technical Advisor to Sky Gold Corp. commented: &quot;This is one of the best greenfield exploration projects that I have been associated with. The potential for discovery of both nickel and gold is very high.&quot;</p><p><strong>VTEM Survey Results:</strong></p><p>The survey yielded both electromagnetic and magnetic data, important tools for the exploration and delineation of targets, in the search for magmatic Ni-Cu-Co-PGE deposits.</p><p>Interpretation of the VTEM data yielded over 70 target areas for follow-up. Compilation of the VTEM data with geological, geochemical and geophysical data in Sky's possession yielded 8 high-priority target areas slated for immediate follow-up and subsequent diamond drilling. None of the high-priority targets have been evaluated by historic diamond drilling.</p><p>The targets ranked as high-priority, comprise single conductors and conductor clusters, delineated over strike lengths ranging from 400 to 1300 metres and are graded as moderate to strong in intensity (Figure 1). Some of the conductors display a positive correlation with magnetic highs while others have weak to moderate magnetic expression.</p><p>Strongly supporting the geophysical targets is an extensive cluster of highly anomalous, nickel, copper, chrome, platinum and palladium values in glacial till, delineated by an Ontario Geological Survey investigation in 2000. The most anomalous samples from the entire survey area occur on the Shebandowan property, featuring values of up to 345 ppm nickel, 44 ppm cobalt, 398 ppm chrome, 4.15 ppb platinum and 4.13 ppb palladium. Several of the highly anomalous till sample sites are closely associated with the geophysical targets graded as high-priority (Figure 2).</p><figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/096e6dfe-cbe2-4cb4-8548-dd1c903232b2/833340/sky1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><div> </div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://pr.report/DM-lLyUp\"><i>https://www.skygoldcorp.com/images/gallery/SKYG_Shebandowan-_Maps-&amp;-Figures_69.jpg</i></a></p><figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/897106d2-2815-4c27-b833-b9ac55823b74/833340/sky2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><div> </div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://pr.report/u8D62JCE\"><i>https://www.skygoldcorp.com/images/gallery/SKYG_Shebandowan-_Maps-&amp;-Figures_70.jpg</i></a></p><p>The geophysical targets and geochemical anomalies coincide with mafic and ultramafic rocks including peridotite, pyroxenite and gabbro flows and sill-like bodies - the same rocks that host the adjoining Shebandowan Ni-Cu-Co-Cr-PGE mines to the immediate north.</p><p>Collectively, the VTEM targets, geochemical anomalies and mafic and ultramafic rocks are closely related to the Tinto Fault and related splays. The Tinto Fault is a deep-seated structure situated at a major terrain boundary, separating rocks of the Shebandowan greenstone belt and younger intrusions to the south. Such a setting is identical to that of the Shebandowan Ni-Cu-Co-PGE mines situated on the Crayfish Creek Fault, a crustal-scale fault situated on the north contact of the greenstone belt with younger intrusions. These deep-seated crustal-scale faults permitted mafic and ultramafic magmas and associated nickel-copper-cobalt-platinum group element mineralization, to reach upper crustal levels to their eventual sites of deposition.</p><p>In addition to the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE potential of the Property, there is excellent potential for the discovery of orogenic gold deposits as well. Historic geochemical work completed by Mingold in the 1990's, delineated an area in the SW part of the Property containing an elevated number of gold grains supplemented by anomalous geochemical assays in gold, at numerous sample sites (the Mingold Au anomaly). This anomaly is located proximal to the Tinto Fault, enhancing the prospects for the occurrence of orogenic gold deposits to occur on the Property (Figure 3).</p><figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/d4b36d00-a714-464b-8809-c42b915cda2e/833340/sky3.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><div> </div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://pr.report/dleTC5qA\"><i>https://www.skygoldcorp.com/images/gallery/SKYG_Shebandowan-_Maps-&amp;-Figures_71.jpg</i></a></p><p><strong>Moving Forward at Shebandowan:</strong></p><p>An integrated exploration program involving soil geochemistry, trenching and diamond drilling will commence on the Shebandowan property in the spring. Detailed soil geochemistry is warranted to more accurately define the highly anomalous Ni-Cu-Co-PGE response patterns obtained in the Ontario Geological Survey regional till survey. In such a survey, tills were collected on 4 square kilometer centres - detailed sampling is required to accurately locate geochemical anomalies and their relationship with the high-priority VTEM targets. Additional till and soil sampling is also required at the site of the Mingold Au anomaly to further define its strength and extent.</p><p>Trenching will be performed where overburden conditions allow, to evaluate high-priority VTEM anomalies coincident with anomalous soil geochemistry underlain by mafic and ultramafic rocks. All high-priority targets are anticipated to be evaluated by diamond drilling this season.</p><p><strong>Thunder Bay North District Potential:</strong></p><p>Given the considerable number of nickel, copper and PGE mineral occurrences in the Thunder Bay North district particularly, the world-class past-producing Shebandowan nickel-copper-cobalt-platinum group element deposit, this district is clearly a premier place for exploring for this suite of metals.</p><p>In addition, the diverse favorable geological setting in the Thunder Bay North district presents many opportunities to make new discoveries and/or to assess older historic occurrences using modern metallogenic models and current exploration technology.</p><p><strong>Qualified person</strong></p><p>Sky Gold Corp.'s disclosure of a technical or scientific nature in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Don Hoy, P.Geo., who serves as a qualified person under the definition of National Instrument 43-101.</p><p><strong>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD</strong><br />Mike England<br />CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR</p><p><strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT</strong><br />Tel: 1-604-683-3995<br />Toll Free: 1-888-945-4770</p><p><i><strong>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Forward Looking Statements</strong></p><p><i>Certain statements in this release are forward-looking statements, which reflect the expectations of management regarding the matters described herein.

The Santa Cecilia project is immediately adjacent to the Norte Abierto project, held by Newmont and Barrick, which is comprised of the Caspiche and Cerro Casale gold - copper porphyry deposits (Figure 1).</p><p><strong>A Message from Shawn Wallace, CEO:</strong></p><p>&quot;We are very pleased to be back drilling at our flagship project, where we have an incredibly rare opportunity to be the first exploration company to comprehensively drill test a property that demonstrates copper and gold mineralization both on surface and at depth and is surrounded by some of the world's largest gold-copper porphyry deposits. The first target we are drilling, Pircas Norte, has outcropping copper porphyry mineralization on surface, a defined geophysical anomaly below surface, is within 1.5 km of the world-class Caspiche deposit, and has never been drill tested. This drill program will continue to evolve based on what we're seeing in preliminary results, and we look forward to providing updates as we progress.&quot;</p><p>The drill program at Santa Cecilia is expected to consist of approximately 1,500 metres (m) over the next 2 months. The initial focus of the drill program will be to test the Pircas Norte target on the eastern region of the project, situated approximately 1.5 km to the west of Norte Abierto's Caspiche deposit. The Pircas Norte target is characterized by outcropping copper porphyry mineralization and an overlapping gold, copper and molybdenum soil anomaly on surface that is approximately 600 m by 600 m with selective rock samples within a dioritic porphyry ranging between 0.3 - 0.83 g/t gold (Figure 2). Subsurface, the Pircas Norte target is associated with a strong magnetic response, low conductivity values, and moderate chargeability values. The magnetic anomaly and low conductivity values are interpreted to be associated with the diorite porphyry body and associated potassic alteration that is viewed on surface (Figures 3 - 4). Finally, the moderate chargeability values at Pircas Norte are interpreted to be the centre of a gold - copper mineralized system that is flanked by high chargeability areas which may represent a pyrite halo to the main porphyry body (Figure 5). The remaining drill holes of the program will be determined based on geological results of the first drill hole.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/228272bd-b5ce-4d56-8d1d-807ded1ac9ac/833131/picture7.png\" width=\"100%\" /><figcaption>Figure 1:Illustrates the location of the Santa Cecilia project in the Maricunga belt and in relation to the Norte Abierto joint venture, held by Newmont and Barrick, which consists of the Caspiche and Cerro Casale deposits.</figcaption></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/3467dde3-f1cc-4eda-b781-e5037303dde3/833131/picture8.png\" width=\"100%\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Illustrates the seven porphyry targets identified at Santa Cecilia and rock results from outcropping porphyry mineralization at the Pircas Norte target, which is within 1.5 km of the Caspiche deposit.

The former Renzy mine operated from 1969 to 1972. UM intrusive bodies host mineralisation at both the Renzy mine and at Lac Brulé. Both sites present several striking similarities including mineralogy, petrology and timing of emplacement.</p><p>A total of 50 samples were carefully collected during the 2023 Phase 1 &amp; 2 drilling programs at the Lac Brulé UM complex (<strong>Figures 1 &amp; 2</strong>) for detailed petrological and mineralogical studies using an optical microscope and a scanning electronic microscope (&quot;<strong>SEM</strong>&quot;). These studies were carried out at the ISTerre of the University of Grenoble Alpes by Professor Christian Picard, university professor (retired) of earth sciences (with special authorisation from Ordre des Géologues du Québec (OGQ)).</p><p>The discovered UM complex is composed of meta-pyroxenite and meta-peridotite, both intruding the highly metamorphic host rock sequence. The meta-pyroxenite includes locally porphyritic assemblages of diopside, magnesio-hornblende and olivine (Fo80-84) with a lesser proportion of enstatite, intercalated with specific mineralized horizons containing up to 30% sulphides mostly as net texture within the silicate gangue.</p><p>Within the intrusive meta-peridotite, low nickel contents were measured in the olivine crystals (800 to 1,600 parts per million (&quot;<strong>ppm</strong>&quot;)) versus an expected nickel range in olivine of 3,000 to 4,000 ppm. This could reflect a strong transfer of nickel from the olivines to the sulphide liquids produced during immiscibility mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Distribution and Composition of Sulphides</strong></p><p>Sulphides present in the pyroxenite sequences (<strong>Table 1</strong>) are pyrrhotite (Ni: 0.17 to 0.66 wt%). chalcopyrite (Cu: 34.56 to 36.27%) and cobalt-rich pentlandite (Ni: 34.56 to 36.73 wt%; Co: 4.15 to 7.33 wt%) present as isolated phases and /or as exsolutions in pyrrhotite <strong>(Figures 3 &amp; 4)</strong>.

With most of the mining and development equipment already at Avino, the Company expects minimal upfront capital needed to begin mine development at La Preciosa.</p><p>Management and the Board of Directors are continuing to review the budget for La Preciosa. The environmental permit has been submitted to the relevant authorities and the timing of expenditures is contingent upon approval.</p><p><strong>Exploration &amp; Evaluation</strong></p><p>The Company's budgeted exploration and evaluation expenditures for 2024 will be focused on regional exploration and further understanding of the structural geology below the current Avino Mine production area, with no drilling planned.

In addition, we were ecstatic to report the best drill intercept in Company history. Following these results, we proceeded with the Pre-Feasibility study on the Oxide Tailings Project following the completion of the metallurgical testwork program. This year has started off with more positive news, as we announced the signing of a long-term land-use agreement with a local community for the development of La Preciosa. We look forward to receiving our full mining permit so we can put that mine into production starting with the Gloria Vein. On top of this, we recently announced the positive economic results of the Pre-Feasibility Study on the Oxide Tailings project and look forward to advancing that project through community engagement. With the completion of this project, we added significant mineral resources that total over 370 million silver equivalent ounces across all properties and for the first time in Avino's history, we have proven and probable mineral reserves, having successfully converted the measured and indicated resources to mineral reserves on the Oxide Tailings. With all of this positive news, we are looking forward to 2024 to continue delivering on our plan for transformational growth. We continue to believe that silver is undervalued and will see higher demand as the global trend for renewables and all things electrified matures.&quot;</p><p><strong>2023 MILESTONES ACHIEVED</strong></p><p>A summary of the achieved objectives and milestones for 2023:</p><ul><li><strong>Updated Mineral Resource Estimate:</strong> <a href=\"https://pr.report/Y2Up5JhG\">On February 16, 2023</a> , an updated mineral resource update was completed and included the Elena Tolosa (&quot;ET&quot;) deposit, the San Gonzalo deposit, and the Oxide Tailings deposit.

(the &quot;<strong>Company</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>GSilver</strong>&quot;) (<strong>TSXV:GSVR)(OTCQX:GSVRF</strong>) is pleased to provide a production update for the month of January 2024. Production results are generated from the Company's wholly owned El Cubo Mines Complex (&quot;<strong>El Cubo</strong>&quot;), Valenciana Mines Complex (&quot;<strong>VMC&quot;</strong>), and San Ignacio Mine (&quot;<strong>San Ignacio</strong>&quot;) in Guanajuato, Mexico, the Topia Mine (&quot;<strong>Topia</strong>&quot;) in Durango, Mexico, and the El Horcon Mine (&quot;<strong>Horcon</strong>&quot;) located in Jalisco, Mexico.</p><p><strong>January 2024 Operations Highlights</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Production during the month of 329,934 silver-equivalent ounces</strong> (&quot;<strong>AgEq*</strong>&quot;) is the 2<sup>ND</sup> highest level of production in the Company's history, and is derived from 141,854 ounces of silver; 1,843 ounces of gold; 279,726 pounds of lead; and 269,276 pounds of zinc. Guanajuato Silver is primarily a precious metals producer; over 90% of silver-equivalent production for the month was derived from silver and gold.</li><li><strong>First month of recently announced 3<sup>rd</sup> party processing agreement adds 40,862 AgEq* ounces, </strong>this represented 12% of total consolidated production for the month. (See Guanajuato Silver news release dated January 17<sup>th</sup> - &quot;<a href=\"https://pr.report/oPL2tl5i\">Guanajuato Silver Commences Processing 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Gold and Silver at El Cubo</a>&quot;).</li><li><strong>Total tonnes mined in January over December increased by 32% </strong>to total 56,691 tonnes. Guanajuato Silver processes mineralized material at three production facilities: El Cubo, Cata (VMC), and Topia.</li><li><strong>Horcon generated 10,183 AgEq* </strong>ounces for the month; to date, the El Horcon mine has produced over 37,000 AgEq* ounces since processing of stockpiled material commenced in late 2023, (See GSilver news release dated November 7, 2023 - &quot;<a href=\"https://pr.report/JCmKnORS\">Guanajuato Silver Initiates Processing of Mineralized Material from El Horcon Mine&quot;).</a> Additional stockpiles exist in the immediate El Horcon area; moreover, the processing of mineralized material from El Horcon is providing valuable information for understanding the potential for underground mining operations.</li><li><strong>Dewatering of the Villalpando area of El Cubo is opening up new zones of deeper, higher-grade material; </strong>mining teams are already working in new areas of the mine that have recently become accessible. By April, dewatering of additional sections of Villalpando is projected to open-up mining blocks that have demonstrated historical grades of over 350g/t AgEq**.</li><li><strong>At Topia, changes to the business model are proving successful</strong>; the adding of additional mine contractors is currently underway and is expected to increase current production volumes by up to 20%. For the month of January, Topia produced 85,083 AgEq* ounces.</li></ul><p>James Anderson, Chairman and CEO, said, &quot;The processing of 3<sup>rd</sup> party mineralized material is already having a substantial impact on total production output; furthermore, El Horcon is generating consistent results and was responsible for over 3% of total AgEq production for the month. These two sources of mineralized material represent a significant component of total production and have contributed to generate our highest volume of silver-equivalent production since May 2023. January's results are further confirmation that the adjustments and efficiency upgrades implemented at our mines during the later-half of 2023 have us on-track in terms of quarter-over-quarter increases in precious metals production. In addition to maintaining a steady ramp-up at our three production facilities, we will continue to make the securing of additional 3<sup>rd</sup> party processing agreements a focus for 2024.&quot;</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:100%\" width=\"100%\"><table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1.0pt solid windowtext;padding:0in

The Company produces silver and gold concentrates from the El Cubo Mine Complex, Valenciana Mines Complex, and the San Ignacio mine; all three mines are located within the state of Guanajuato, which has an established 480-year mining history. Additionally, the Company produces silver, gold, lead, and zinc concentrates from the Topia mine in northwestern Durango. With four operating mines and three processing facilities, Guanajuato Silver is one of the fastest growing silver producers in Mexico.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>&quot;James Anderson&quot;</strong><br /><strong>Chairman and CEO</strong></p><p>For further information regarding Guanajuato Silver Company Ltd., please contact:</p><p>JJ Jennex, Gerente de Comunicaciones, T: 604 723 1433<br />E: <a href=\"mailto:jjj@GSilver.com\">jjj@GSilver.com</a><br />Gsilver.com</p><p><i><strong>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p>This news release contains certain forward-looking statements and information, which relate to future events or future performance including, but not limited to, the dewatering of additional sections of Villalpando being projected to open-up mining blocks that have demonstrated historically grades of over 350g/t AgEq*; the addition of additional mine contractors at Topia and its expected to increase current production volumes by up to 20%; expected quarter-over-quarter increases in precious metals production; the steady ramp-up at the Company's three production facilities; securing of additional 3rd party processing agreements being a focus for 2024; and the Company's status as one of the fastest growing silver producers in Mexico.</p><p>Such forward-looking statements and information reflect management's current beliefs and expectations and are based on information currently available to and assumptions made by the Company; which assumptions, while considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject to significant operational, business, economic and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies. These assumptions include: our estimates of mineralized material at El Cubo, VMC, San Ignacio and Topia and the assumptions upon which they are based, including geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results and metallurgical performance; available tonnage of mineralized material to be mined and processed; resource grades and recoveries; assumptions and discount rates being appropriately applied to production estimates; the ability of the Company to ramp up processing of mineralized material at Cata at the projected rates and source sufficient high grade mineralized material to fill such processing capacity; prices for silver, gold and other metals remaining as estimated; currency exchange rates remaining as estimated; availability of funds for the Company's projects and to satisfy current liabilities and obligations including debt repayments; capital cost estimates; decommissioning and reclamation estimates; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation) and inflation rates remaining as estimated; no labour-related disruptions; no unplanned delays or interruptions in scheduled construction and production; all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner; and the ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.</p><p>Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements and information are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results, level of activity, production levels, performance or achievements of GSilver to differ materially from those expected including, but not limited to, market conditions, availability of financing, future prices of gold, silver and other metals, currency rate fluctuations, rising inflation and interest rates, actual results of production, exploration and development activities, actual resource grades and recoveries of silver, gold and other metals, availability of third party mineralized material for processing, unanticipated geological or structural formations and characteristics, geopolitical conflicts including wars, environmental risks, operating risks, accidents, labor issues, equipment or personnel delays, delays in obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and permits, inadequate insurance, and other risks in the mining industry. There are no assurances that GSilver will be able to successfully discover and mine sufficient quantities of high grade mineralized material at El Cubo, VMC, San Ignacio and Topia for processing at its existing mills to increase production, tonnage milled and recoveries rates of gold, silver, and other metals in the amounts, grades, recoveries, costs and timetable anticipated. In addition, GSilver's decision to process mineralized material from El Cubo, VMC, San Ignacio, Topia and its other mines is not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and therefore is subject to increased uncertainty and risk of failure, both economically and technically. Mineral resources and mineralized material that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability, are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them, and may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, and other relevant issues. There are no assurances that the Company's projected production of silver, gold and other metals will be realized. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will meet its production forecasts or generate the anticipated cash flows from operations to satisfy its scheduled debt payments or other liabilities when due or meet financial covenants to which the Company is subject or to fund its exploration programs and corporate initiatives as planned. There is also uncertainty about the continued spread and severity of COVID-19, the ongoing war in Ukraine and rising inflation and interest rates and the impact they will have on the Company's operations, supply chains, ability to access mining projects or procure equipment, supplies, contractors and other personnel on a timely basis or at all and economic activity in general. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or information. All forward-looking statements and information made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR at <a href=\"https://pr.report/cfoxVHdW\">www.sedar.com</a> including the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The AuEq formula is Au (g/t) + Ag (g/t)x(Ag price/Au price) + Cu (g/t) x (Cu price per troy ounce/Au price) + Pb (g/t )x( Pb price per troy ounce/Au price) + Zn (g/t) x( Zn price per troy ounce/Au price). Prices in pounds converted to prices per troy ounce. One pound = 453.6 grams; one troy ounce = 31.10 grams.</p><p>&quot;We are pleased with the results of this first drill program at the Pucamayo East project&quot; stated Ever Marquez, Condor's VP Exploration. &quot;Our maiden drill program has identified a substantial mineralized and altered area with locally elevated precious and base metals with some of the best values coming near surface. Intercepts include both long intervals of low grade precious and base metal mineralization as well as local high-grade structures, notably 18.96 g/t AuEq over 2.0m. We have tested only a small part of Pucamayo and are excited by the potential that remains in what appears to be a much larger mineralized system.&quot;</p><p>Six of the nine drillholes tested the extent of high sulphidation type epithermal gold and silver bearing outcropping ledges of breccia and four of these (PUC-E-001, 007, 008 and 009) intersected near surface gold-silver-poly metallic intervals ranging from 3.8m to 52.2m, and grades from 0.1 to 1.1 g/t AuEq. Two holes (PUC-E-002 and 003) drilled to the east and collared higher in elevation encountered barren steam heated host rocks interpreted to lie above the mineralized zones intersected in PUC-E-001, 007, 008 &amp; 009. A detailed drill hole location map is available on the Company website.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://pr.report/YjtdueNS\">https://condorresources.com/site/assets/files/3982/pucamayo_east_drillhole_map_and_details.jpg</a>)</p><p>Three deeper holes (PUC-E-004, 005, and 006) tested an outcropping area of multi phase stockwork and alteration associated with anomalous gold and copper with associated IP chargeability and resistivity anomalies interpreted to be an intrusive related system. The best of these, PUC-E-005 intersected a 72.5 interval from 190-262.5m grading 0.45 g/t Au, 30 g/t Ag (0.83 g/t AuEq) including a 2 m high grade interval of 11.43 g/t Au, 687 g/t Ag (18.96 g/t AuEq). PUC-E-006 intersected a 2m interval grading 7.97 g/t Au, 20.9 g/t Ag (8.26 g/t AuEq). All three of these holes encountered extensive amounts of pyrite and discontinuous zinc, copper, and lead mineralization associated with argillic/phyllic altered andesitic/dioritic host rocks.</p><p>Condor recognizes that the inaugural drill program has tested a relatively small portion of the 4 sq km area of argillic/silicic alteration zone present on the property. This large alteration zone is interpreted to represent a halo or high level-lithocap lying above a potentially mineralized porphyry system at depth to the southeast of the drilled area. (Please refer to Figure 1) This area lies within the Company's concessions, but requires an expansion of the permitted (DIA) work area. Mineralogical (Terraspec) studies to evaluate alteration zoning are currently underway on material collected from the recent drilling program to assist in vectoring towards future potential target areas.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/a5079419-4929-4de1-b896-fc2a2c615500/833337/picture1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><p style=\"text-align:center;\">FIGURE 1: Area of argillic/silicic alteration interpreted to represent a halo or high level lithocap southeast of 2023 drilled area</p><p>Condor is an active explorer focused exclusively on Peru, supplemented by a project generator and royalty model designed to generate exploration capital whilst minimizing shareholder dilution.

S (<strong>TSX:MNO</strong>)(Frankfurt/Tradegate:<strong>2MM</strong>)(OTCQX:<strong>MRRDF</strong>) (&quot;Meridian&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) is pleased to announce strong results from its first Bore Hole Electromagnetic surveys (&quot;BHEM&quot;) at its Santa Helena high-grade deposit (&quot;Santa Helena&quot;). BHEM has modelled conductive plates as down-dip extensions of high-grade Cu-Au-Ag &amp; Zn mineralization recently reported by the Company. This includes a 175m projection of CD-359's higher-grade core that assayed 9.4m @ 1.9g/t AuEq from 13.0m<sup>1</sup> (&quot;Figure 1&quot;). This plate projects past the modelled limits of Santa Helena's Exploration Target<sup>1</sup>, expanding the potential footprint of future drill targets (&quot;Figure 2&quot;). The BHEM program commenced at the western limit of Santa Helena and is progressing eastwards and will test for further in-hole and off-hole responses to target sulphide extensions. Further drill assays and geophysical survey results are pending for Santa Helena and Cabaçal.</p><p><strong>Highlights Reported Today</strong></p><ul><li>Meridian expands Santa Helena's Cu-Au-Ag &amp; Zn mineralization upside further to the west &amp; south;</li><li>175m long conductive plate modelled down-dip from recent high-grade drilling &amp; expands upside past historical mine's limits;</li><li>Multiple BHEM plates coincident with the projection of new high-grade intersections at Santa Helena;</li><li>Geophysical survey projects mineralization outside of Exploration Target's upside limits; and</li><li>Surface geophysical program progressing eastward; targeting to connect with Álamo trend.</li></ul><p>Merdian is integrating its recent and historical drill results of Santa Helena with a full suite of down hole and surface geophysical techniques to map and extend the known high-grade Cu-Au-Ag &amp; Zn mineralization, and to expand its upside potential. To date, this has extended the 1.0km limits of the historical resource into a 3km long prospective corridor. The Company will continue to concentrate its resource program within a 1.4km core zone, while continuing a step out drill program along the eastern extension to the mine.</p><p>Mr. Gilbert Clark, CEO, comments: <i>&quot;Santa Helena continues to show expanded potential well past our original expectations. The initial BHEM results from the mine's western limits have delivered extensional targets for high-grade Cu-Au-Ag &amp; Zn mineralization that are projecting well beyond the Exploration Target's upside limits. The geophysical team is now focusing on extending their programs easterly along Santa Helena's prospective target corridor. We believe we are at the start of an exciting new phase of discovery, and our objective is to test the potential for Cabaçal to grow to be a world-class camp.&quot;</i></p><p>_______________________________<br /><sup>1</sup> <sub>Meridian Mining news release dated December 5, 2023</sub></p><p><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/63ccb322-fa32-4120-997f-0678a616a036/833260/meridanfig1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><i>Figure 1: Santa Helena drill highlights with newly modelled BHEM conductive plates.</i></p><p><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/3e47db0c-93de-4b80-a00a-81ba7b99c810/833260/meridanfig2.png\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><i>Figure 2: Santa Helena Exploration Target upside model, together with recent geophysical plate models associated with new intersections highlighting growth potential.</i></p><p><strong>Santa Helena Update</strong></p><p>The Santa Helena Cu-Au-Ag &amp; Zn VMS deposit, located ~9km to the southeast of the Cabaçal Mine, represents the Company's second open pit development target in the 50+ km Cabaçal Belt. The Company is leveraging off a historical drill dataset including over 10,000 m of drilling, and combined with its recent drill results, has defined an Exploration Target for the deposit area of 3.2 - 7.2 Mt @ 3.0 - 3.2g/t AuEq. Following initial successful verification drilling which commenced in August 2023<sup>2</sup>, the ongoing resource definition drilling program has confirmed the presence of significant mineralization both within the historical envelope, up-dip to the historical envelope, across-strike in a new second sulphide layer, and up to 510m along strike from the historic resource limits (assays pending). Highlights from drilling to date<sup>3</sup> include:</p><ul><li>CD-325: 14.9m @ 4.6 g/t AuEq from 26.3m;</li><li>CD-329: 6.8m @ 7.4g/t AuEq from 38.7m;</li><li>CD-332: 5.8m @ 6.8g/t AuEq from 32.2m;</li><li>CD-335: 7.2m @ 6.0g/t AuEq from 35.5m;</li><li>CD-360: 16.4m @ 0.9g/t AuEq from 6.0m &amp; 11.0m @ 5.2g/t AuEq from 30.0m;</li><li>CD-416: 13.2m @ 2.1g/t AuEq from 11.0m &amp; 16.6m @ 2.1g/t AuEq from 41.4m;</li><li>CD-411: 22.5m @ 1.9g/t AuEq from 11.0m; and</li><li>CD-378: 5.9m @ 5.5g/t AuEq from 38.3m.</li></ul><p>Meridian's first phase of surface geophysics focused on Electromagnetic (&quot;FLTEM&quot;) and Induced Polarization (&quot;IP&quot;) surveys, which revealed a broader than expected chargeability response over the Santa Helena deposit, and with conductive FLTEM plates dipping northwards from the deposit<sup>4</sup>. Progression of the IP grid has defined a 2km eastern extension of the chargeability trend<sup>5</sup>. The Company focused initially on verification drilling, and subsequently on testing the shallow up-dip and strike extensions of the deposit. The results have achieved and exceeded expectations: firstly, confirming the significant high-grade Cu-Au-Ag &amp; Zn VMS mineralization in the mine area, and then confirming extensions beyond the limits of the historical resource, in areas previously not drill tested. The recent drilling combined with BHEM now shows that intersections have associated conductive plates indicative of sulphide mineralization.</p><p>Recent down-hole survey platforms have tested the western and southern margins of the deposit, resolving a number of conductors of near-mine exploration significance (Figure 1; Figure 2).</p><p>The conductive response at the western margin of the deposit is marked by an interpreted plate of ~175 x 100m extent, with a conductivity of 10 Siemens. The down-dip extension of the conductor projects beyond the limit of the Exploration Target upside model, and further drilling will be required to test areas remaining open in the target.</p><p>Additional survey platforms on the southern flank of the deposit show conductors in the CD-360 - CD-416 area, again associated with strong intersections. Modelled plates are 15 to 30m in strike and dip, with a conductivity of 5 to 30 Siemens.</p><p>In addition to the planned near-mine BHEM and Mise-a-la-Masse surveys making use of new drill platforms, our geophysical survey team will expand the surface FLTEM and gravity surveys to refine targets in the open eastern extensions to the mineral system over Álamo.</p><p>_______________________________<br /><sup>2</sup> <sub>Meridian Mining news release dated August 8, 2023</sub><br /><sup>3</sup> <sub>Meridian Mining news releases dated September 12 &amp; 27, October 23, November 14, 2023, and January 10, 2024.</sub><br /><sup>4</sup> <sub>Meridian Mining news release dated January 24, 2023</sub><br /><sup>5</sup> <sub>Meridian Mining news release dated October 23, 2023</sub></p><p><strong>About Meridian</strong><br />Meridian Mining UK S is focused on:</p><ul><li>The development and exploration of the advanced stage Cabaçal VMS gold‐copper project;</li><li>Regional scale exploration of the Cabaçal VMS belt; and</li><li>Exploration in the Jaurú &amp; Araputanga Greenstone belts (the above all located in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil).</li></ul><p>Cabaçal is a gold-copper-silver rich VMS deposit with the potential to be a standalone mine within the 50km VMS belt.

Samples are dried, crushed with 70% passing &lt;2mm, split off to give a mass of approximately 250g, and pulverized to &gt;85% passing 200#. Routine gold analyses have been conducted by Au-AA23 (fire assay of a 30g charge with AAS finish). High-grade samples (&gt;10g/t Au) are repeated with a gravimetric finish (Au-GRA21). Samples are held in the Company's secure facilities until dispatched and delivered by staff and commercial couriers to the laboratory. Pulps and coarse rejects are retained and returned to the Company for storage. The Company submits a range of quality control samples, including blanks and gold and polymetallic standards supplied by Rocklabs, ITAK and OREAS, supplementing laboratory quality control procedures. Approximately 5% of archived samples are sent for umpire laboratory analysis, including any lots exhibiting QAQC outliers after discussion with the laboratory. In BP Minerals sampling, gold was analysed historically by fire assay and base metals by three acid digest and ICP finish at the Nomos laboratory in Rio de Janeiro. Silver was analysed by aqua regia digest with an atomic absorption finish. True width is considered to be 80-90% of intersection width. Assay figures and intervals are rounded to 1 decimal place. Gold equivalents for Cabaçal are calculated as: AuEq(g/t) = (Au(g/t) * %Recovery) + (1.492*(Cu% * %Recovery)) + (0.013*(Ag(g/t) * %Recovery)), where:</i></p><ul><li><i>Au_recovery_ppm = 5.4368ln(Au_Grade_ppm)+88.856</i></li><li><i>Cu_recovery_pct = 2.0006ln(Cu_Grade_pct)+94.686</i></li><li><i>Ag_recovery_ppm = 13.342ln(Ag_Grade_ppm)+71.037</i></li></ul><p><i>Recoveries based on 2022 metallurgical testwork on core submitted to SGS Lakefield</i></p><p><i>Gold equivalents for Santa Helena are based on metallurgical recoveries from the historical resource calculation, updated with pricing forecasts aligned with the Cabaçal PEA.

        "body": "<p><strong>TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / February 12, 2024 / Lahontan Gold Corp (TSXV:LG)(OTCQB:LGCXF) </strong>(the &quot;<strong>Company</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>Lahontan</strong>&quot;), is pleased to provide the following review of key milestones achieved by the Company during 2023 and to lay out Lahontan's mine development and exploration plans for 2024. 2023 was a transformative year for the Company, beginning with the January release of the maiden Mineral Resource Estimate* (&quot;MRE&quot;) for its 26.4 km<sup>2 </sup>flagship Santa Fe Mine project located in the Walker Lane of mining friendly Mineral County, Nevada. Lahontan also completed two fully subscribed financings raising over $5.1M, drilled almost 3,700 metres in the Slab-Calvada resource area, initiated base-line cultural and environmental studies covering almost half the Santa Fe Mine project, acquired the 19.7 km<sup>2</sup> West Santa Fe Au-Ag project, expanded Santa Fe via staking by 7.5 km<sup>2</sup>, and completed a comprehensive review/audit of all past metallurgical testing and production reports for Santa Fe. Details are below:</p><p><strong><u>Santa Fe Mine Project MRE*:</u></strong> The MRE for Santa Fe, released in January 2023, was based upon 1,275 drill holes totaling 125,435 metres, including 50 drill holes totaling 13,118 metres drilled by Lahontan since 2021 (the MRE does not include holes drilled later in 2023). Highlights of the MRE include:</p><ul><li>Project-wide pit constrained Indicated Mineral Resources of 1,112,000 contained gold equivalent (&quot;Au Eq&quot;) ounces and Inferred Mineral Resources of 544,000 contained Au Eq ounces. (Au Eq is based on the following formula: Au Eq g/t = Au g/t + (Ag g/t/75) and adjusted for historic differences in Au and Ag recovery during mine operations as described in the MRE).</li><li>Project-wide average grade for the Indicated Mineral Resource is <strong>1.14 g/t Au Eq</strong>; the average grade of the Project-wide Inferred Mineral Resource is <strong>1.00 g/t Au Eq</strong>.</li><li>Indicated <u>Oxide</u> Resources total 21.6 Mt grading 1.03 g/t Au Eq for 712,000 Au Eq<i> </i>ounces and Inferred <u>Oxide</u> Resources total 11.1 Mt grading 0.73 g/t Au Eq for 262,000 Au Eq ounces.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Corporate Financings:</u></strong> The Company closed two equity financings during 2023, the first closing in February and March, the second closing in September (please see Company press releases dated February 28, March 8, and September 1, 2023). Combined, the financings raised over $5.1M, leaving Lahontan well-financed to aggressively pursue its exploration and mine development programs.</p><p><strong><u>Excellent Drilling Results in the Slab-Calvada area at Santa Fe:</u></strong> Lahontan completed 3,687 metres of reverse-circulation drilling in 18 holes in the Slab-Calvada resource area at the Santa Fe Mine project. The drilling targeted extensions of known resources, defined by the Company's NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report and MRE*, beyond the conceptual pit shells used in the MRE. Drilling highlights include:</p><ul><li><strong>38.1 metres grading 0.87 g/t Au and 2.5 g/t Ag (0.89 gpt Au Eq)</strong> <strong>of oxide</strong> metallurgical domain mineralization in drill hole CAL23-004R <strong>including 10.6 metres grading 2.02 g/t Au and 2.4 g/t Ag (2.04 gpt Au Eq)</strong>.</li><li><strong>82.3 metres grading 0.68 g/t Au and 2.0 g/t (0.70 gpt Au Eq) of oxide </strong>metallurgical domain mineralization in drill hole CAL23-001R, including 21.3 metres grading 0.93 gpt Au and 1.9 gpt Ag (0.95 gpt Au Eq).</li></ul><p>* Please see the Santa Fe Project Technical Report, Authors: Trevor Rabb and Darcy Baker, P. Geos. Effective Date: December 7, 2022, Report Date: March 2, 2023. The Technical Report is available on the Company's website and SEDAR</p><p>The Slab-Calvada area is particularly important from a mine development perspective as gold and silver mineralization crops out at the surface, is completely oxidized, and would therefore be a logical area to resume mining operations. Lahontan believes that this drill campaign was highly successful in expanding the footprint of oxide gold and silver mineralization; this data will be included in an updated technical report as described below (please see Lahontan press releases dated June 27, July 18, and September 12, 2023 for more information).</p><p><strong><u>Plan of Operations: </u></strong>In March 2023, Lahontan and its consultants began work preparing an exploration Plan of Operations (&quot;POO&quot;) for the Santa Fe Mine Project. The POO covers approximately 12.1 km<sup>2 </sup>of the 19.1 km<sup>2</sup> Project area. The first phase of work is the completion of environmental baseline studies to document biological, cultural, and surface water resources. Completion of the environmental baseline studies allows the POO to be designed to avoid specific resource conflicts. Eventual approval of the POO by the Federal Bureau of Land Management (&quot;BLM&quot;) will allow more surface disturbance on the property giving Lahontan the ability to continue to explore and expand the current mineral resources as well as provide baseline data that can be used in future mine permitting. Work completed to date includes:</p><ul><li>Project initiation meeting with the BLM</li><li>Biological baseline survey work plan</li><li>Two special status plant surveys</li><li>First burrowing owl survey</li><li>Two acoustic bat surveys</li><li>Seeps and springs surveys</li><li>Majority of cultural surveys completed</li></ul><p>Upcoming work:</p><ul><li>Final cultural survey before reporting</li><li>Cultural reporting and agency review</li><li>Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 biological surveys including flowering plants and raptor surveys</li></ul><p><strong><u>West Santa Fe Acquisition:</u></strong> In July 2023, Lahontan announced an agreement to acquire the advanced West Santa Fe gold-silver exploration project (&quot;West Santa Fe&quot;; also known as Mindora), located only 13 km southwest of the Santa Fe Mine project. West Santa Fe hosts an oxidized gold-silver epithermal mineralized system in a geologic setting similar to Santa Fe. Previous exploration drilling at West Santa Fe totals over 13,000 metres in 171 drill holes; only five holes are deeper than 165 metres. Preliminary modeling of drill hole data by Lahontan geologists outlines a significant, shallow, oxidized gold and silver system.</p><p>The acquisition agreement requires Lahontan to make payments totalling US$1.8M over a seven-year period, back-end loaded, to exercise an option to acquire a 100% interest in West Santa Fe. The option payments can be made in a combination of cash and shares at Lahontan's discretion. In addition, the Company will commit to exploration expenditures totalling US$1.4M over the same seven-year period, these expenditures should be sufficient to define an initial mineral resource estimate for West Santa Fe (please see Lahontan press releases dated May 15, July 20, August 15, and August 16, 2023 for more details).</p><p>Lahontan also acquired an additional 794 hectares of mineral rights at West Santa Fe by staking 95 unpatented lode mining claims; the Project now covers a of total 19.7 km<sup>2 (</sup>please see Lahontan press release dated May 31, 2023). The Lahontan geologic team concluded that there was potential for significant resource expansion outside the original West Santa Fe claim group. The new unpatented mining claims also cover areas that could be used for potential future mining infrastructure such as heap-leach facilities.</p><p><strong><u>Expand Santa Fe Mine Project:</u></strong> Lahontan significantly expanded its land holdings at its flagship Santa Fe Mine project by staking 98 unpatented lode mining claims covering over 7.5 km<sup>2</sup> in November 2023. The newly staked claims cover possible extensions to the Slab gold and silver resources*, other exploration targets covered by young gravel, and a vast area of flat terrain that could be suitable for mine infrastructure such as heap leach pads and waste rock dumps. The Santa Fe Mine now covers over 26.4 km<sup>2</sup> adding to the 64.1 km<sup>2</sup> the Company controls in Nevada's prolific Walker Lane.</p><p><strong><u>Metallurgical Data Review: </u></strong>The data review was completed by Kappes, Cassiday and Associates (&quot;KCA&quot;) of Reno, Nevada, a global leader in metallurgical and process consulting. KCA reviewed metallurgical test work on oxide gold and silver mineralization completed by previous operators of the Santa Fe Mine as well as production data. When recovery estimates of the individual deposits are applied to the MRE shown in the Santa Fe Mine Technical Report*, it results in weighted <strong>project-wide gold recoveries of 74.4% for gold and 29.0% for silver</strong> at a ½-inch crush size from oxide mineralization (please see Lahontan press release dated January 22, 2024 for more information).</p><p>KCA believes that there is sufficient data available to establish recovery ranges of oxide gold and silver mineralization for inclusion in a Preliminary Economic Assessment (&quot;PEA&quot;). This is a result of previous operational data, and the amount of column leach testing available on the component that makes up the bulk of the resource (the Santa Fe pit resource).</p><p><strong><u>Plans and Catalysts for 2024:</u></strong> Kimberly Ann, Founder, CEO, President and Director provided the following summary of Company objectives for 2024: &quot;Certainly 2023 was an enormous year for the Company, establishing the size and scale of oxide mineral resources at Santa Fe and clearly moving Lahontan from being a pure explorer to a future mine developer. As we have outlined, the two critical paths going forward in 2024 for the Company will be completing a PEA for Santa Fe and submitting a Plan of Operations to the Federal Bureau of Land Management. These two key steps set the stage for a potential Santa Fe production decision in 2024. We are currently evaluating proposals from multiple prominent consulting groups to prepare the Santa Fe PEA. We expect to select a group to lead the PEA process shortly.</p><p>Simultaneously, we intend to design and permit a Phase one drill program for West Santa Fe, evaluate further drilling at the Santa Fe Mine project, and of course, continue to seek out opportunities that allow the Company to jump-start the growth curve.&quot;</p><p><i><strong>About Lahontan Gold Corp.</strong></i></p><p>Lahontan Gold Corp. is a fully financed Canadian mine development and mineral exploration company that holds, through its US subsidiaries, four top-tier gold and silver exploration properties in the Walker Lane of mining friendly Nevada. Lahontan's flagship property, the 26.4 km<sup>2</sup> Santa Fe Mine, had past production of 345,000 ounces of gold and 711,000 ounces of silver between 1988 and 1995 from open pit mines utilizing heap-leach processing (Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 1995). The Santa Fe Mine has a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 compliant Indicated Mineral Resource of 1,112,000 oz Au Eq<i> </i>(grading 1.14 g/t Au Eq) and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 544,000 oz Au Eq (grading 1.00 g/t Au Eq), all pit constrained (Au Eq is inclusive of recovery, please see Santa Fe Project Technical Report*). The Company will continue to aggressively explore Santa Fe during 2024 and begin the process of evaluating development scenarios to bring the Santa Fe Mine back into production.

        "body": "<p><strong>COEUR D'ALENE, ID / ACCESSWIRE / February 12, 2024 /</strong> Idaho Strategic Resources (NYSE American:IDR) (&quot;IDR&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) is pleased to announce that it has purchased the Butte Gulch property located next to the Company's producing Golden Chest Mine.</p><p>The Butte Gulch property is comprised of approximately 169 acres of private land and mineral rights located directly east and adjacent to the Golden Chest Mine. The Butte Gulch property was placer mined for gold as many as four separate times over its history, however, it is relatively unexplored for its lode deposit potential. In addition to the property's proximity to IDR's operations, mineralized gold veins have been reported on the property by prior operators (and observed by IDR geologists) indicating the potential to host additional lode gold deposits. Butte Gulch is also a strategic purchase for the Company due to its potential to serve as the future site for a shop and/or new milling facilities as Idaho Strategic continues to expand its operations in the greater Murray Gold Belt (MGB) district.</p><p>The Company's 2024 plans include an increased focus in the MGB and enhanced production at the Golden Chest. The addition of Butte Gulch to Idaho Strategic's district-scale Murray Gold Belt landholdings further demonstrates an emphasis on increasing IDR's exploration efforts on locating additional mines within the Company's property package. The Company also recently purchased around $1 million of equipment for the new mill tailings paste backfill system (to replace the current more expensive cemented rock backfill process). It is estimated that the addition of a paste backfill system will result in cost savings of approximately $20 per tonne of ore. Both the purchase of Butte Gulch and the paste backfill system are considered important components in the planning for and eventual operation of new milling facilities in the MGB.</p><p>The Murray Gold Belt district was originally discovered in 1883 leading to a gold rush in the area until the early 1890's when silver was discovered nearby in the Silver Valley, leaving the Murray Gold Belt largely forgotten. With much of the greater MGB owned or controlled by one or two ‘non-mining' groups since the early 1900's, little modern exploration has been conducted in the past 100 years (other than by IDR). Given the presence of numerous historic gold mines and prospects throughout the district, Idaho Strategic is planning to be the first Company to conduct a comprehensive test of the district. Relatively recent IDR samples from the surface and underground have yielded values ranging from 5 to 75 grams per tonne (gpt) gold exposed in veins related to igneous activity. In addition to our own sampling, IDR's geologists have undertaken steps to aggregate its own prior drill data and information learned from historic mines in the MGB to design an exploration plan. It is reported that from about 1885 to 1926, approximately 200,000 ounces of gold was recovered from placer mining in Prichard Creek, which runs along IDR's extensive land package<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><i><sup>1 </sup>Dort, Wakefield. 1958. Gold-Bearing Gravels near Murray, Idaho</i></p><p>Idaho Strategic's President and CEO, John Swallow stated, &quot;Butte Gulch is a piece of property that we have had our eye on since the very beginning. Not only because the property is adjacent to our mine and makes a lot of sense for us strategically, but because I believe it is a desirable parcel of land from a real estate perspective as well. Our geologists are already making plans to better explore Butte Gulch's lode deposit potential and to expand our exploration focus beyond the Golden Chest Mine across our greater Murray Gold Belt landholdings. The Golden Chest sits on approximately 220 acres of private land. We consolidated the district for a reason, and strongly feel there are other veins similar to the H-Vein, Paymaster, and Klondike in the MGB (comprised of over 7,000 acres), especially given the large number of historic mines and prospects within its borders as a base from which to build.</p><p>Additionally, we purchased the long-lead time components of our new paste backfill system. This will allow us to backhaul tailings filtercake from the New Jersey Mill to be used to backfill mined underground stopes. We feel this system has the potential to save the company around $500,000 to $800,000 annually once fully in place while also extending the life of our current tailings storage facility. Personally, if it works as planned, I see the paste backfill system as a ‘low cost/high return' component of a new mill facility and something we could put in place now while still using the New Jersey Mill. Having an existing mill and facilities allows us the operational and financial flexibility to step toward a ‘new mill' near the mine in the strategic manner of our choosing.&quot;</p><p>In consideration for the purchase of Butte Gulch, Idaho Strategic has agreed to an overall purchase price of $1,000,000 inclusive of a $350,000 down payment at closing, and monthly interest-only payments for the next 3 years followed by a balloon payment for the remaining amount due at that time. The term of the loan can also be extended if needed.</p><p><strong><u>Qualified Person</u></strong></p><p>IDR's Vice President, Grant A.

No historical assay results for the 2007 series drillholes were available and no collar locations for the 2010 series drillholes were previously verified. Neither series (except for two of the 2010 drillholes) were utilized in the current Shasta MRE<sup>1</sup> published by TDG (news release <a href=\"https://pr.report/p9tfOxHW\">May 01, 2023</a>). The collar locations have now been verified and the new assay data supports inclusion of these higher grade, near surface intercepts in a future MRE<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><u>Highlights include (see </u><strong><u>Appendix</u></strong><u> for complete results):</u></p><ul><li><strong>SH07-16:</strong> (JM East; <strong>Figure 1 and Figure 2</strong>): 60.0 m grading 1.04 grams per tonne (&quot;g/t&quot;) gold (&quot;Au&quot;) and 57 g/t silver (&quot;Ag&quot;) [1.75 g/t gold equivalent (&quot;AuEq&quot;<sup>2</sup>)] from 3.0 m depth and ending in mineralization,<ul><li><i><strong>Including 43.1 m grading 1.27 g/t Au and 67 g/t Ag [2.11 g/t AuEq<sup>2</sup>] from 20.0 m depth</strong></i></li></ul></li><li><strong>SH07-04:</strong> (Shasta; <strong>Figure 2</strong>): 65.0 m grading 0.64 g/t Au and 18 g/t Ag [0.87 g/t AuEq<sup>2</sup>] from 78.0 m depth<ul><li><i><strong>Including 25.7 m grading 1.52 g/t Au and 40 g/t Ag [2.02 g/t AuEq<sup>2</sup>] from 78.0 m depth</strong></i></li></ul></li><li><strong>SH07-10:</strong> (Creek; <strong>Figure 2</strong>): 53.0 m grading 1.08 g/t Au and 33 g/t Ag [1.49 g/t AuEq<sup>2</sup>] from 66.0 m depth<ul><li><i><strong>Including 25.3 m grading 1.93 g/t Au and 62 g/t Ag [2.71 g/t AuEq<sup>2</sup>] from 72.0 m depth</strong></i></li></ul></li><li><strong>SH07-14:</strong> (Creek; <strong>Figure 2</strong>): 63.7 m grading 0.87 g/t Au and 42 g/t Ag [1.40 g/t AuEq<sup>2</sup>] from 43.8 m depth<ul><li><i><strong>Including 28.5 m grading 1.56 g/t Au and 86 g/t Ag [2.63 g/t AuEq<sup>2</sup>] from 45.5 m depth</strong></i></li></ul></li></ul><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/882972ea-9007-4218-a04c-0c6b4c561fc0/832961/picture1.png\" width=\"100%\" /></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 1.</strong><i> Cross Section 6347515N Diamond Drillhole SH07-16.</i></p><p>Steven Kramar, TDG's VP Exploration, commented: &quot;<i>Historical sampling of core was focused on narrow zones of higher-grade mineralization. TDG's systematic recovery of this legacy core, followed by relogging, resampling and assaying of the entire mineralized envelope, has yielded meaningful rewards, demonstrating consistent wide zones of gold-silver mineralization that encompass notable intercepts with significantly higher grades. With these data, including more detailed logging and geochemistry, we can better define controls on mineralization and use that knowledge to extrapolate potential extensions to the current MRE<sup>1</sup>. We will be reviewing these new assay results to determine how they might influence the current Shasta MRE<sup>1</sup>.&quot;</i></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto\" width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/383d26b6-a22b-4480-9732-5d3abdf1ed08/832961/picture2.png\" width=\"100%\" /></figure><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 2. </strong>Shasta Plan Map.</p><p><strong>2007 Series Drilling</strong></p><p>The 2007 diamond drilling was mostly located along the western side of the Shasta deposit, in the Shasta zone (<strong>Figure 2, green circles</strong>). Historically, core was cut and sent for analysis, but the legacy data (assays and drill logs) were never located by TDG. TDG has now successfully located and validated the 2007 series drill collars and subsequently relogged, resampled and sent all recoverable drillcore for analysis of the precious metal content and a full suite of multi-element geochemistry. These drillholes add additional multi-element data TDG's existing database, and the precious metal assay results may positively impact the current Shasta MRE<sup>1</sup> by improving confidence between existing drillholes and adding higher grades in areas with sparse drilling (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><p><strong>2010 Series Drilling</strong></p><p>The 2010 series of diamond drilling was focused within the Cayley-Rainer zone (<strong>Figure 2, blue circles</strong>). This zone has demonstrated potential to host bonanza grades, with SH21-022 intersecting<i><strong> 1.5 m grading 50.2 g/t Au and 4,871 g/t Ag [111 g/t AuEq<sup>1</sup>] from 113.5 m depth</strong></i> (see <a href=\"https://pr.report/LYqIU8xe\">news release Feb 07, 2022</a>)<i>. </i>Previously, the 2010 series drilling also suffered from poor collar validation and only two drillholes were sufficiently accurately recorded to support inclusion within the 2023 MRE<sup>1</sup> calculation. As with the 2007 drillholes, the remaining 2010 drill collars have since been validated, and therefore this data may now be used in a potential MRE<sup>1</sup> update. Additionally, these new assays and geochemical data could provide clues on vectoring between the Cayley-Rainer zone and the JM zone (~400 m distance). This is an area where drill and historical assay density is currently the lowest at Shasta and the new information could potentially expand the bonanza grade mineralization intercepted in 2021.</p><p><strong>1980s Series Drilling</strong></p><p>In 2023, TDG also undertook a broader relogging, resampling and assaying program to target (a) the satellite deposits within the Greater Shasta target area and (b) potential extensions to the mineralization at the Shasta deposit. The drillcore from the Cody Lee target area<sup>5</sup> and the Fisher target area<sup>5</sup> were recovered and cores from 7 and 6 holes, respectively, were relogged, resampled and assayed in entirety; results are pending. Around the main Shasta deposit, drillcore with the potential to assist in upgrading the MRE<sup>1</sup> and provide valuable multi-element data were also relogged and resampled from the JM east, Shasta north and Shasta Creek areas, all within the MRE<sup>1</sup> area. These samples are being processed through the assay lab and results will be published in due course.</p><p><strong>QA/QC</strong></p><p>Samples for the Shasta 2023 relogging, resampling and assay program were handled via rigorous chain of custody, through sample collection, processing, and delivery to the ALS Global laboratory in either North Vancouver or Kamloops, B.C. The drillcore was logged, photographed, and sampled at TDG's Baker Mine site and processed by geologists and technicians. The drillcore selected for sampling was either: (i) already split from previous sampling (mechanized core splitter or rarely diamond saw) and sample intervals were utilized (where applicable) to follow along historical sampling intervals or (ii) intervals with no previous sampling were split using mechanical splitter. The drillcore selected for sampling was and then placed in zip-tied polyurethane bags, then in security-sealed rice bags before being delivered directly by TDG staff from the Baker Mine site, to Bandstra Transportation Systems in Prince George, ultimately to the ALS Global facility in North Vancouver or Kamloops, B.C. Samples were prepared and analyzed following procedures: PREP-31BN for sample preparation, AU-AA25 for Au and ME-MS61 for Ag and trace elements. Overlimit concentrations of precious or base metals were analyzed (where applicable) by AU-GRA22, AG-GRA21 and/or ME-OG62 for Au, Ag and base metals, respectively. Information about methodology can be found on the ALS Global website, in the analytical guide (<a href=\"https://pr.report/eTrbA243\">here</a>).</p><p>QAQC is maintained internally at the lab through rigorous use of internal certified reference materials (&quot;CRMs&quot;), blanks, and duplicates. An additional QAQC program was administered by TDG through the verification of lab results via use of CRMs and blank (unmineralized) samples that were blindly inserted into the sample batch. Duplicates (pulp) were selected approximately every 20 samples by internal lab procedures. If a QAQC sample returns an unacceptable value an investigation into the results is triggered and when deemed necessary, the samples that were tested in the batch with the failed QAQC sample are re-tested.</p><p><strong>Table 2</strong> presents the particulars for the drillholes in this news release. Collar locations were derived from a previous operators database, converted into UTM UPS NAD83 Zone: 9N coordinate format and validated (where practical and/or possible) using high accuracy Differential Global Positioning System (&quot;DGPS&quot;) system. Collars were also validated against historical maps and files where possible.</p><p><strong>Table 2. </strong><i>Drillhole Collar Information.</i></p><div style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"

has been reviewed and approved Steven Kramar, MSc., P.Geo., Vice President, Exploration for TDG Gold Corp., a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.</p><p><strong><sup>1</sup>Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE)</strong>: All scientific and technical information relating to the TDG's Shasta Project pertaining to the Mineral Resource Estimate (&quot;Shasta MRE&quot;) contained in this news release is derived from the Technical Report dated June 14, 2023 (with an effective date of February 11, 2023) titled &quot;The Toodoggone Portfolio and the 2023 Resource Estimate for the Shasta Deposit&quot; (the &quot;2023 Technical Report&quot;) prepared by Sue Bird, MSc., P.Eng. of Moose Mountain Technical Services. The information contained herein in respect of the Shasta MRE is subject to all of the assumptions, qualifications and procedures set out in the 2023 Technical Report and reference should be made to the full text of the 2023 Technical Report, a copy of which has been filed with the securities regulators in each of the provinces of Canada (except Québec) and is available on <a href=\"https://pr.report/Ev6BsutN\">www.sedarplus.ca.</a></p><p><sup>2</sup><strong>Gold Equivalent</strong> (<strong>AuEq</strong>): Gold Equivalent (AuEq) is used for illustrative purposes, to express the combined value of Au and Ag as a percentage of Au on an in-situ basis. Calculations are uncut and recovery is assumed to be 90% for each metal with an Au price of US$1,800/oz and an Ag price of US$22.50/oz (based on trends over the past approximately three years), giving an 80:1 silver to gold ratio for AuEq calculation purposes. Actual prices and recoveries (following metallurgical test work) may differ from these assumptions, which would change the ratio.</p><p><strong><sup>3</sup>Unassayed Historical Drillcore</strong>: Historical drillcore intersections, lengths or intervals referenced for re-assay or geological analysis may not be available or suitable for sampling. Historical drillcores were inherited with the project and these unassayed drillcores may or may not (1) be part of the remaining historical core inventory, (2) be available and/or (3) have not degraded to a state that would render them wholly unusable for the purposes of scientific investigation. These historical un-assayed drillcores may or may not host precious or base metal mineralization.</p><p><sup>4</sup><strong>Indicated/Inferred Mineral Resources</strong>: TDG is a mineral exploration focused company and the Company's Projects are in the mineral exploration stage only. The degree of risk increases substantially where an issuer's properties are in the mineral exploration stage as opposed to the development or operational stage. Confidence in an inferred/indicated mineral resource estimate is insufficient to allow meaningful application of the technical and economic parameters to enable an evaluation of economic viability sufficient for public disclosure, except in certain limited circumstances set out in NI 43-101. There is no assurance that mineral resources (of any class) will be converted into mineral reserves. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to a indicated mineral resource with continued exploration and proper scientific evaluation.</p><p><sup>5</sup><strong>Mineral Exploration/Exploration Target Area(s)</strong>: Exploration targets and/or Exploration zones and/or Exploration areas are speculative and there is no certainty that any future work or evaluation will lead to the definition of a mineral resource.</p><p><strong><sup>6</sup>Historical Data:</strong> This news release includes historical information that has been reviewed by TDG's qualified person (QP). TDG's review of the historical records and information reasonably substantiate the validity of the information presented in this news release; however, TDG cannot directly verify the accuracy of the historical data, including (but not limited to) the procedures used for sample collection and analysis. Therefore, any conclusions or interpretations borne from use of this data should be considered too speculative to suggest that additional exploration will result in mineral resource delineation. TDG encourages readers to exercise appropriate caution when evaluating these data and/or results.</p><p><strong><sup>7</sup>Historical Drillcore Sampling &amp; Assay Methodology</strong>: Historical drillcore that has not been relogged, resampled and assayed by TDG was geologically logged with lithologies identified and notable geological features recorded by prior operators. That historical drillcore was split in half (and in rare cases sawn in half) along sample intervals (lithology and mineralization dependant) generally less than 3 m by those operators. Chemical analysis was performed dominantly for precious metal analysis (Au and Ag), and infrequently for base metals (Pb, Zn, Cu), and rarely for major elements and trace elements. Historically, different commercial laboratories were utilized in addition to an assay lab at Baker Mine Site. These lab facilities may or may not have had accreditation and in all cases accreditation (if applicable) pre-dated current ISO standards. Over that period, a variety of digestion and assay methods were used, including atomic absorption, fire assay atomic absorption, aqua regia atomic absorption and aqua regia ICP, with varying detection limits. Reference materials (if any) were inserted at the analytical level and thus were unblind to the facility processing the samples.</p><p><strong>About TDG Gold Corp.</strong></p><p>TDG is a major mineral tenure holder in the historical Toodoggone Production Corridor of north-central British Columbia, Canada, with over 23,000 hectares of brownfield and greenfield exploration opportunities under direct ownership or earn-in agreement. TDG's flagship projects are the former producing, high-grade gold-silver Shasta and Baker mines, which produced intermittently between 1981-2012, and the historical high-grade gold Mets developed prospect, all of which are road accessible, and combined have over 65,000 m of historical drilling. The projects have been advanced through compilation of historical data, new geological mapping, geochemical and geophysical surveys and, at Shasta, 13,250 m of modern HQ drill testing of the known mineralization occurrences and their potential extensions. In May 2023, TDG published an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for Shasta (see TDG news release <a href=\"https://pr.report/NADnCT6X\">May 01, 2023</a>) which remains open at depth and along strike. In January 2023, TDG defined a larger exploration target area adjacent to Shasta (Greater Shasta-Newberry; see TDG news release <a href=\"https://pr.report/1iXNylP9\">January 25, 2023</a>). In 2023, TDG published the first modern drill results from the Mets mining lease (see TDG news releases <a href=\"https://pr.report/iOAKdTyP\">September 07, 2023</a>, <a href=\"https://pr.report/S2CBExM1\">September 11, 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://pr.report/tkzFE3dI\">November 28, 2023</a>).</p><p><strong>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD</strong></p><p>Fletcher Morgan<br />Chief Executive Officer</p><p>For further information contact:</p><p>TDG Gold Corp.,<br />Telephone: +1.604.536.2711<br />Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@tdggold.com\">info@tdggold.com</a></p><p><i>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</i></p><p><strong>Forward Looking Statements</strong></p><p><i>This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the Company's current expectations and estimates.

Samples were prepared and analyzed for gold using the fire assay technique (PE01S method; 25 gram charge), followed by measuring the gold in solution with flame AAS equipment. Samples for multi-element analysis (BM011 and over-range methods as required) use aqua regia digestion and ICP-MS analysis. The QA/QC program of Southern Cross Gold consists of the systematic insertion of certified standards of known gold content, blanks within interpreted mineralized rock and quarter core duplicates. In addition, On Site inserts blanks and standards into the analytical process.</p><p>MAW considers that both gold and antimony that are included in the gold equivalent calculation (&quot;AuEq&quot;) have reasonable potential to be recovered at Sunday Creek, given current geochemical understanding, historic production statistics and geologically analogous mining operations. Historically, ore from Sunday Creek was treated onsite or shipped to the Costerfield mine, located 54 km to the northwest of the project, for processing during WW1. The Costerfield mine corridor, now owned by Mandalay Resources Ltd contains two million ounces of equivalent gold (Mandalay Q3 2021 Results), and in 2020 was the sixth highest-grade global underground mine and a top 5 global producer of antimony.</p><p>SXG considers that it is appropriate to adopt the same gold equivalent variables as Mandalay Resources Ltd in its Mandalay Technical Report, 2022 dated 25 March 2022. The gold equivalence formula used by Mandalay Resources was calculated using recoveries achieved at the Costerfield Property Brunswick Processing Plant during 2020, using a gold price of US$1,700 per ounce, an antimony price of US$8,500 per tonne and 2021 total year metal recoveries of 93% for gold and 95% for antimony, and is as follows: \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC5E = \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC62 (\uD835\uDC54/\uD835\uDC61) + 1.58 × \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC4F (%).</p><p>Based on the latest Costerfield calculation and given the similar geological styles and historic toll treatment of Sunday Creek mineralization at Costerfield, SXG considers that a \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC5E = \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC62 (\uD835\uDC54/\uD835\uDC61) + 1.58 × \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC4F (%) is appropriate to use for the initial exploration targeting of gold-antimony mineralization at Sunday Creek.</p><p><strong>About Mawson Gold Limited (TSXV:MAW, FRANKFURT:MXR, OTC PINK:MWSNF)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://pr.report/iMYXyGL4\">Mawson Gold Limited</a> has distinguished itself as a leading Nordic exploration company.
